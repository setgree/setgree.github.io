# Talking to Bernie Sanders about Eugene Debs

Jill Lepore of the New Yorker recently wrote a [wonderful review](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/02/18/eugene-v-debs-and-the-endurance-of-socialism) of [Eugene V. Debs: A Graphic Biography](https://www.versobooks.com/blogs/4117-sneak-peak-of-eugene-v-debs-a-graphic-biography). I love these kinds of book reviews in general, by the way. They seem to be only tangentially about the book, and more an occasion to revisit the life of someone interesting.

Debs is a name I recognized from high school, if at all. I don't remember him coming up in the American politics classes I took in college or in 2 years of a political science PhD program (One does not attend a PhD program to acquire general-purpose knowledge). So I learned a few things from this review.

The first is that Debs came up fighting for the right to unionize about railroad workers, pitted against George Pullman.

* Archer
* Song of the Lark
* Why do libertarians oppose unions? Whom to unionize with and when seems every bit as personal as whom to sleep with -- which is to say, outside of broad constraints (relationships should be between consenting, compos mentis adults), it's none of the government's business.
* But it certainly was in the 19th century. So when I read this, the bad team, to me, is clearly the people using the guns.


The second is that Debs was on the right side of racial justice. (But then, so was George Pullman!)

The third is that he went to jail for speaking out against WW I.

The fourth is that Bernie Sanders idolizes him.

Looking at the above, I see nothing but things to admire. Courage, moral vision, inclusiveness.

Bernie sees the same story and concludes we need more centralized power. But Mr. Sanders: if you build it, you won't control it forever. There are men with guns behind your proposal to have more federal control over colleges.

So, how bedrock are our disagreements? What might that conversation look like?
