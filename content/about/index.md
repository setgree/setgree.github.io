Hi I'm Seth! I am currently hiking the Appalachian Trail. Previously  I was a  Data Analyst at [Riskified](https://www.riskified.com/) and before that, Developer Advocate at [Code Ocean](https://codeocean.com/). In my free time, I am  working on a meta-analysis with a few folks at/formerly at [Betsy Levy Paluck's lab at Princeton](.http://www.betsylevypaluck.com/).

I like cartoons and animal sanctuaries and in quarantine-times I've been finding a lot of joy in Lambchop's ['The Hustle'](https://genius.com/Lambchop-the-hustle-lyrics), and, more recently, 'Viking folk' like [Eldrim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfyPSUgkUbY) and [Wardruna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEizKmZlUAw).

I write the content locally on Rstudio with [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/), push its source code to [GitHub](https://github.com/setgree/setharielgreen), and deploy from there with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
