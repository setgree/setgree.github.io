<p>Wagner’s antisemitism<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> doesn’t bother me when I listen to his music because, at least for the music of his that I know, I don’t see any connection between his hatred for Jews and the text. <em>Ride of the Valkyries</em> works as an independent statement of grandeur. But when R. Kelly sings</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My mind’s tellin’ me no, but my body, my body’s tellin’ me yes</p>
</blockquote>
<p>it reads like a defense of his horrible behavior; the context of his despicableness suffuses the text. When you cue that song up on Youtube, in a tiny way, you’re literally buying his defense. That’s a very different stance for a listener. For me, it’s untenable.</p>
<p>Cf. Michael Jackson, whose music is much creepier than I remember it being as a kid<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> (my friend Roger suggested these snippets):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You’ve been hit by/You’ve been hit by/A smooth criminal</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And no one’s gonna save you/From the beast about to strike</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Other obvious examples: Woody Allen has a famous movie <a href="https://nexttribe.com/woody-allens-manhattan/">featuring himself dating a teenager</a>, the very title of Louis CK’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Love_You,_Daddy">movie</a> seems like the expression of a horrible man’s fantasies <em>and</em> it features an <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2017/11/the-uncomfortable-masturbation-scene-in-louis-c-k-s-movie.html">extended pantomimed masturbation scene played for laughs</a> – there is <em>no line here</em> between context and text for these men and their products. My intuition is that when this <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=legion+of+horribles+blood+meridian&amp;oq=legion+of+horribles+blood+meridian&amp;aqs=chrome.0.0j69i57.7531j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">legion of horribles</a>, this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basket_of_deplorables">basket of deplorables</a>, makes art, the presumption should be that it is intended as a defense of (or distraction from<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>) their despicableness, and consuming it is an act of endorsement, or at least of suggesting an open mind to their apologias.</p>
<p>This has some uncomfortable implications for me as a consumer. The sharp angles and misplaced bodyparts in Picasso’s <a href="https://www.anothermag.com/art-photography/8799/the-women-behind-the-work-picasso-and-his-muses">portraits</a> render his woman subjects ghastly, grotesque, visually dehumanized. So yes, the context of his being <a href="https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2017/11/09/how-picasso-bled-the-women-in-his-life-for-art/">famously awful to women in his life</a> matters. Shall I boycott Picasso, and the museums that host his work? I am not ready to do so, but I don’t have a good reason why I shouldn’t. One thing that occurs is that he’s already dead, so it’s not like I’m benefiting the abuser. But I don’t see why that should matter.</p>
<p>Some less highfalutin examples: Apparently TJ Miller <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T.J._Miller#Legal_issues_and_controversies">actually <em>is</em></a> <a href="https://silicon-valley.fandom.com/wiki/Erlich_Bachman">Erlich Bachman</a>, and his performance on <em>Silicon Valley</em> is (to me) an all-time great embodiment of male cluelessness. Is it unethical to pay him for playing a horrible man on TV, if the excellence of his performance stems from his being one in real life?<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Ditto for Aziz Ansari’s apparently being just as creepy as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Haverford">Tom Haverford</a> is on <em>Parks and Recreation</em> – his character is one of my least favorite things about a show I like, but it’s not as though, when I’m watching on Netflix, I can make micropayments during scenes I like to signal that I think Amy Poehler’s performance is Emmy-worthy and that they should write Tom off the show.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>Insofar as I spend many hours a week engaging with art (broadly defined to include TV, books, videogames, etc.), thje question of what art to engage with and why is important. I can think of examples that are clearly “no,” where the context and the text are patently isomorphic (Woody Allen, Louis CK), and those that are clearly “I don’t care” (Wagner, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Walker#Accusations_of_antisemitism">Alice Walker</a>, <a href="https://genius.com/14074">Public Enemy</a>).<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>But for cases in between these extremes, I more or less seem to decide based on whether I feel disgust when I engage with the material, which does not seem to be a very reliable basis for good moral decisions. I am not sure what else to do, and the people around me mostly seem to consume without apparent concern for their marginal contribution towards broken systems (this is a pattern I seek to reject in other aspects of life – e.g. eating meat).</p>
<p>If I come up with a better answer, I’ll let you know.</p>
