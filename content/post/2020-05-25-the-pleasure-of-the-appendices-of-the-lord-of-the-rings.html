<p><strong>Author’s Note</strong>: This post isn’t going to make a lot of sense if you aren’t already familiar with <em>LOTR</em>, <em>The Hobbit</em>, etc.</p>
<p>In the foreword to the second edition of <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>, Tolkien writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is perhaps not possible in a long tale to please everybody at all points, nor to displease everybody at the same points; for I find from the letters that I have received that the passages or chapters that are to some a blemish are all by others specially approved.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Allow me to cast a vote of special approval for Appendices A and B – particularly the sections about the dwarves of the Lonely Mountain, the three Elven rings, and the elves of the Woodland Realm, Lothlórien, and what they were doing immediately before and during the <a href="https://lotr.fandom.com/wiki/War_of_the_Ring">War of the Ring</a>. These passages provide the all-too-rare (in literature and in life) pleasure of <em>context</em>.</p>
<p><em>LOTR</em> covers a lot of territory – in multiple senses, but here I mean just the <a href="http://lotrproject.com/map/#zoom=3&amp;lat=-1681.5&amp;lon=1500&amp;layers=BTTTTTTTT">physical ground the characters cross</a> to get from the Shire to Mount Doom – but in the end, just about every (ininjured) main character converges on Mordor, either at its gate or its forge. The notable exceptions are the Elf-Lords introduced in <em>Fellowship</em>, and most of the main cast of the <em>Hobbit</em> (and their descendants). Asking “what was my personal favorite character doing during the big battle??” is the kind of thing that keeps fantasy readers up at night (posting such questions on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SwordOfTruth/">r/SwordOfTruth</a> or equivalent).</p>
<p>Tolkien provides. Galadriel, Celeborn and the Galadhrim were fending off three successive attacks on Lothlórien (appendix B, the on(e that’s a timeline of events), King Brand of the Dale and Dáin II Ironfoot fall in the <a href="https://lotr.fandom.com/wiki/Battle_of_Dale">Battle of Dale</a>, but delay Sauron’s forces in the North enough for the forces in the South to have something to return to after the <a href="http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Battle_of_the_Morannon">Battle of the Morannon</a>. As Gandalf says in <em>Appendix A: Annals of the Kings and Rulers, III: Durin’s Folk</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Think of what might have been. Dragon-fire and savage swords in Eriador, night in Rivendell. There might be no Queen in Gondor. We might now hope to return from the victory here only to ruin and ash.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tolkien has pulled off a marvelous trick here. He’s answered questions about broader events in Middle Earth that <em>only some readers might have</em>, which has the dual effects of A) keeping the central narrative streamlined and B) attending to the desire for completeness of his more obsessive fans. He’s also turned the second half of <em>The Hobbit</em>– everything after Bilbo wins the ring from Gollum – into a marvelous plot payoff, because if not for the defeat of Smaug and the subsequent alliance of elves, dwarves and men in the Battle of the Five Armies, the North wouldn’t have been unified, which means the forces of Dol Guldur would have swept down unopposed and laid ruin to Gondor. To quote Gandalf again, continuing from before:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We might now hope to return from the victory here to ruin and ash. But that has been averted — because I met Thorin Oakenshield one evening on the edge of spring in Bree. A chance-meeting, as we say in Middle-earth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Aha, you might think, reading this. So that’s why <em>The Hobbit</em> matters, and how it fits in. That’s why Galadriel didn’t send forces to</p>
