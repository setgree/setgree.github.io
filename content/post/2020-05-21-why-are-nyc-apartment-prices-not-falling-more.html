<h3>Why haven’t prices fallen?</h3>
<p>I have an apartment in New York. I don’t currently reside there and will move out when the lease ends (in about a month). It seems that Manhattan is somewhere you wouldn’t want to be right now if you could be anywhere else.</p>
<p>So why aren’t real estate prices cheaper?</p>
<p>Browsing streeteasy, I get the sense that prices are reduced <em>slightly</em> from what they were three months ago, despite it being the epicenter of a pandemic, and therefore:</p>
<ul>
<li>the things that make New York special (food, opera, whatever your thing is) are basically completely in abeyance;</li>
<li>everyday things like exiting and leaving your building are much more fraught than they used to be;</li>
<li>if people are the ultimate amenity, a lot of them are gone.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, if I didn’t know better, I’d expect prices there to be a mass exodus of renters, and for prices to reflect the suddenly high supply-to-demand ratio. What gives?</p>
<p>Possibly, prices might fall a lot in the summer (assuming lots of people, like me, end their leases and landlords find it difficult to replace them).</p>
<p>Another possibility: rent stabilization laws put a floor on how much many landlords are willing to let prices drop.</p>

<h3>Working through a simple example:</h3>
<ul>
<li>About a million apartments in New York are rent-stabilized if not rent controlled.</li>
<li>Let’s say you (the landlord) have a rent-stabilized apartment that, in normal times, rents for $2000/month.</li>
<li>The actual market-clearing price for the apartment during these weird times is $1000/month.</li>
<li>You estimate that, over the next 10 years, you’ll only be able to raise the rent an average of 5% per year (you can’t get a perfect estimate of this because legislation is liable to change the rate).</li>
<li>If an apartment is vacant, you can raise rents by up to 20%.</li>
<li>In 2 years time, you expect the apartment to be worth $2000/month again.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="what-would-you-do" class="section level3">
<h3>What would you do?</h3>
<p>On the one hand, you could leave the apartment up on Streeteasy for $2000/month, even though you think that it will stay vacant for two years. On paper, you’re going to lose $48,000 in that time – but remember, the true, market-clearing price for the aparmtent is $1000/month, so you’re actually losing $24,000. In two years time, you expect to be able to rent it for $2000/month and increase the rent by 5% every year for the following 8 years.</p>
<p>On the other, you could reduce the price to $1000 and then aim to raise the price by 5% every year for the next ten years.</p>
<p>In the first scenario, your income for the 10 year period is (this is going to fast and loose, I’m sure there’s some <code>lapply</code> way to do it better):</p>
<pre class="r"><code>rent_calc &lt;- function(base_amount, increase_rate, years) {
  rent &lt;- (base_amount * 12)
  appreciation &lt;- 1 + increase_rate
  for(i in 1:(years-1)){
    rent &lt;- rent + (base_amount * appreciation^i * 12)
  }
  print(rent)
}

rent_calc(2000, 0.05, 8)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 229178.6</code></pre>
<p>vs, in the second scenario:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>rent_calc(1000, 0.05, 10)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 150934.7</code></pre>
<p>$150,934.7 – it’s not even close. You lose about $78,000 over the course of 10 years if you put the apartment on the market now.</p>
<p>What if the maximum appreciation rate were 10%, and in 10 years time, you thought that the apartment would still be worth $2000?</p>
<p>Putting it on the market for $1000 now, you’d get:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>rent_calc(1000, .1, 10)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 191249.1</code></pre>
<p>Leaving it vacant and then charging $2000/month every year for the following 8:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>2000 * 12 * 8</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 192000</code></pre>
<p>You’re still slightly better off leaving it off the market.</p>
<p>Am I right? I played a little fast and loose with the details here and I am not totally sure I got rent stabilization right :) But let’s say I’m right; if so:</p>
</div>
<div id="a-prediction-and-a-suggestion" class="section level3">
<h3>A prediction and a suggestion</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>A lot of apartments will come on the market this year with provisions like “3 months free” (effectively reducing the monthy rent by a lot, but, as far as I know, a provision not covered by typical rent stabilization provisions)</p></li>
<li><p>If you like the looks of an apartment, and you have a good relationship with the landlord (or think you could develop one), you could strike a sweet deal here. For this hypothetical $2000 apartment, tell them that you’re willing to pay $1000 a month – one suspects that lanldords are feeling a little cash-strapped at the moment, so you could offer to pay 3 months upfront in cash – and you’ll sign whatever paperwork you need to, or agree to any contract, that gives the appearance that the actual rent on the place is $2000. Why not sweeten the deal and sign a stipulation saying that the landlord can charge you whatever she likes in a year and if you dispute it, the case gets automatically referred to a private arbitrator of the landlord’s choosing?</p></li>
</ol>
<p>That’s what I would do if I were you and it was time to renegotiate a lease.</p>
