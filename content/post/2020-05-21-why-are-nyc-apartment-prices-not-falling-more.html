<h3>Observations:</h3>
<p>I have an apartment in New York. I don’t currently reside there and will move out when the lease ends (in about a month). It seems that Manhattan is somewhere you wouldn’t want to be right now if you could be somewhere ele. We know that there’s been something of an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/16/nyregion/nyc-coronavirus-moving-leaving.html">exodus from the city</a>.</p>
<p>So why aren’t rental prices cheaper?</p>
<p>Browsing <a href="https://streeteasy.com/for-rent/nyc">streeteasy</a>, I get the sense that prices have fallen <em>slightly</em> from where they were three months ago, despite New York being the epicenter of a pandemic, and therefore:</p>
<ul>
<li>the things that make it special (food, opera, whatever your thing is) are basically in complete abeyance;</li>
<li>the tradeoff you made to have a perfectly located apartment – you get no direct sunlight but you’re near your favorite ramen place and you spend most of your day out of the house anyway – suddenly sucks;</li>
<li>everyday things like exiting and entering the building you share with elderly neighbors are much more fraught than they used to be;</li>
<li>if people are the ultimate amenity, a lot of them are gone</li>
</ul>
<p>So, if I didn’t know better, I’d expect there to be a lot of broken leases, and suddenly available apartments, but for no commensurate uptick in demand for housing – and for prices to reflect that. What gives?</p>
<p>My theory is that rent stabilization laws put a floor on how much much landlords are willing to let prices drop.</p>

<div id="working-through-an-example" class="section level3">
<h3>Working through an example:</h3>
<ul>
<li>About a million apartments in New York are rent-stabilized if not rent controlled.</li>
<li>Let’s say you (the landlord) have a rent-stabilized apartment that, in normal times, rents for $2000/month.</li>
<li>The actual <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_clearing">market-clearing</a> price for the apartment right now is $1,500/month.</li>
<li>You estimate that, over the next 10 years, you’ll only be able to raise the rent an average of 5% per year (you can’t get a perfect estimate of this because legislation is liable to change the rate).</li>
<li>In 2 years time, you expect the apartment to be worth $2000/month again.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="what-would-you-do" class="section level3">
<h3>What would you do?</h3>
<p>On the one hand, you could leave the apartment up on Streeteasy for $2,000/month, even though you think that it will stay vacant for two years. On paper, you’re going to lose $48,000 in that time – but remember, the true, market-clearing price for the aparmtent is $1,500/month, so you’re actually losing $36,000. In two years time, you expect to be able to rent it for $2,000/month and increase the rent by 5% every year for the following 8 years.</p>
<p>On the other, you could reduce the price to $1500 and then aim to raise the price by 5% every year for the next ten years.</p>
<p>In the first scenario, your income for the 10 year period is:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>rent_calc &lt;- function(base_amount, increase_rate, years) {
  rent &lt;- (base_amount * 12)
  appreciation &lt;- 1 + increase_rate
  for(i in 1:(years-1)){
    rent &lt;- rent + (base_amount * appreciation^i * 12)
  }
  print(rent)
}

rent_calc(2000, 0.05, 8)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 229178.6</code></pre>
<p>vs, in the second scenario:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>rent_calc(1500, 0.05, 10)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 226402.1</code></pre>
<p>So you’re a litlte better off leaving the apartment vacant for the next two years.</p>
<p>I&quot;ve played it fast and loose with the details here – rent-stabilization is complicated, applies only to certain buildings, vacant units aren’t costless, etc. But if this story is basically right:</p>

<div id="a-prediction-and-a-suggestion" class="section level3">
<h3>A prediction and a suggestion</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>A lot of apartments will come on the market this year with perks like “3 months free,” which effectively reduce rent by a lot, but, as far as I know, aren’t typically covered by rent stabilization laws;</p></li>
<li><p>If you’re renewing a lease, and you have a good relationship with your landlord, you could strike a sweet deal here. For this hypothetical $2,000 apartment, tell them that you’re willing to pay $1000 a month, with the first 6 month upfront in cash, and you’ll sign whatever deal they offer that puts the price of the apartment, on paper, at $2,000 a month. If you really want to <a href="https://spectacledavenger.blogspot.com/2010/08/jon-elster-ulysses-and-sirens.html">tie your hands to the mast</a>, how about suggesting binding arbitration in the case of a dispute about any rent increase in a year’s time?</p></li>
</ol>
<p>That’s what I would do if I were renegotiating a lease.</p>
