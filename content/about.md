Hi I'm Seth! I work as a research specialist in [Betsy Levy Paluck's lab at Princeton](http://www.betsylevypaluck.com/). I was formerly Developer Advocate at [Code Ocean](https://codeocean.com/), and before that, I studied political science at Swarthmore (2006-2010) and Columbia (2013-2015).

I like cartoons and animal sanctuaries and in quarantine-times I've been finding a lot of joy in Lambchop's ['The Hustle'](https://genius.com/Lambchop-the-hustle-lyrics).

I write the content locally on Rstudio with [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/), push its source code to [GitHub](https://github.com/setgree/setharielgreen), and deploy from there with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
