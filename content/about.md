Hi I'm Seth! I work as a research specialist in [Betsy Levy Paluck's lab at Princeton](http://www.betsylevypaluck.com/). I was formerly Developer Advocate at [Code Ocean](https://codeocean.com/), and before that, I studied political science at Swarthmore (2006-2010) and Columbia (2013-2015).

I like cartoons and animal sanctuaries and when people get along.
