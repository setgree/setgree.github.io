      <description>On an episode of Indian Matchmaking, our hero Nadia meets a potential suitor named Vinay at a restaurant and learns that he keeps to a vegan diet. “It was honestly just curiosity,” he says. “Are you ok if I get…” Nadia trails off. “Oh yeah yeah, of course!” he says. “Like, I grew up non-veg, like uh, thirty-five years of my life is non-veg,” and they laugh about it.</description>

      <title>An adjective I think about a lot</title>

      <description>In An Electronic Soundtrack for Spiritual Awakening, Kelefa Sanneh calls Jon Hopkins “one of the most celebrated electronic musicians of his generation.” Now, I like Hopkins’s music a lot – Collider, Light Through the Veins, Open Eye Signal, and Emerald Rush are all a lot of fun – but “one of the most celebrated”? I think not, at least, not the way Metro Boomin’s tracks with Future are literally present at celebrations all around America, because he makes, get this, popular music.</description>

      <title>It&#39;s weird that no one on &#34;The Good Place&#34; wants children</title>

      <description>(Spoilers for the whole show)
because the show draws so obviously from conservative, christian beliefs about the purpose of life.
One of the people I watched TGP with speculated that there are no actual children in the good place – as in, the place portrayed on the show, both its bad-place-masquerade and true form – because it would be too depressing for the audience to contemplate dead kids. I’m not against that – I could have read Gravity’s Rainbow in the same time it took to watch TGP, but it was a pandemic, and I was looking for the familiar pleasures of a network sitcom: easy to digest and comforting.</description>

      <description>An article in the Times reports local opposition to redeveloping Industry City in Brooklyn. In Councilman Menchacha’s letter on the subject:
 I firmly believe housing is a human right and that no one should be forced to leave their home because they can no longer afford to live in their own neighborhood….I and my team are committed to working with everyone in the neighborhood to build on a legacy of community-led and comprehensive planning that creates guaranteed housing and jobs</description>

      <description>I would like to figure out when and how to engage with artists who are bad people.
On the one hand, Richard Wagner did not much care for Jews – and not just in the way that was cant for 19th century Germans, but actively going out of his way to disparage Jews and Jewish composers.1 This doesn’t bother me, and I think it’s because I don’t see any connection between his music and his beliefs.</description>

      <description>Sixty-four in all! I had a sense of what some of these meant but included them if I wasn’t pretty sure, and a lot of the usages were archaic.
The joy of putting together a list like this was both learning a bunch of fun words and also engaging with the people who have tread before me in understanding LOTR minutiae, e.g., the folks who wrote the Tolkien Glossary and Tolkien and the OED.</description>

      <description>Author’s Note: This post isn’t going to make a lot of sense if you aren’t already familiar with LOTR, The Hobbit, etc.
In the foreword to the second edition of The Lord of the Rings, Tolkien writes:
 It is perhaps not possible in a long tale to please everybody at all points, nor to displease everybody at the same points; for I find from the letters that I have received that the passages or chapters that are to some a blemish are all by others specially approved.</description>

      <description>Hi I&amp;rsquo;m Seth! I am a Data Analyst at Riskified. Before this, I was Developer Advocate at Code Ocean. In my free time, I am working on a meta-analysis with a few folks at/formerly at Betsy Levy Paluck&amp;rsquo;s lab at Princeton.
I like cartoons and animal sanctuaries and in quarantine-times I&amp;rsquo;ve been finding a lot of joy in Lambchop&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;The Hustle&amp;rsquo;, and, more recently, &amp;lsquo;Viking folk&amp;rsquo; like Eldrim and Wardruna.</description>
