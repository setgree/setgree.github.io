      <description>So far, I’ve found it pretty viable. I am a Python n00b but used it a bit to create my last post (source .Rmd here).
The main advantage is that it brings all the key bindings I’m used to. YMMV, but I also really like how easy Rstudio makes it to execute code as I’m iterating, whether in a script or the interpreter. As far as I know, there’s no “Python-first” IDE that does this as well as Rstudio does this for R.</description>
