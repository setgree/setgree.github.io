      <description>, she lends the full weight of her celebrity to the words;
 Finally taking flight
I know you don’t think it’s right
I know that you think it’s fake
Maybe fake’s what I like

      <description>Observations, and arguments worth responding to:
Michael Huemer observes – in Dialogues on Ethical Vegetarianism, and in a recent Cato Unbound series on What moral considerations do humans owe animals – three things that I agree with and think about a lot:
 Eating meat is the worst thing that he has ever done (I think this is true for me as well); Factory farming is at least a plausible contender for the most important ethical issue today; “Given that nearly every person in America buys animal products from factory farms on a regular basis, it should be easy to find someone to defend the morality of that practice.</description>

      <description>was published last week, on which yours truly is a co-author.
Its abstract (emphasis added):
 Ongoing technological developments have made it easier than ever before for scientists to share their data, materials, and analysis code. Sharing data and analysis code makes it easier for other researchers to reuse or check published research. However, these benefits will emerge only if researchers can reproduce the analyses reported in published articles and if data are annotated well enough so that it is clear what all variable and value labels mean.</description>

      <description>Author’s Note: This post isn’t going to make a lot of sense if you aren’t already familiar with LOTR, The Hobbit, etc.
In the foreword to the second edition of The Lord of the Rings, Tolkien writes:
 It is perhaps not possible in a long tale to please everybody at all points, nor to displease everybody at the same points; for I find from the letters that I have received that the passages or chapters that are to some a blemish are all by others specially approved.</description>

      <title>Is Florida doing a great job handling things?</title>

      <description>Rich Lowry thinks so. He interviews Ron DeSantis and his colleagues, who seem to have focused on keeping very vulerable people in nursing homes safe, and frames the piece as “liberal media can’t admit that Trump-friendly guy is doing a good job.”1
First question: what is the general consensus on Florida’s COVID response? When I searched Google News for “Florida” and “Coronavirus,” I found little that evalauted its overall response, but a lot of stories about a Florida data scientist who was apparently fired for not faking the data.</description>

      <description>Observations:  I have an apartment in New York. I don’t currently reside there and will move out when the lease ends (in about a month). Many people I know are in the same boat (and we know there’s been something of an exodus from the city).  This feels like it should be a major supply-demand readjustment. But prices don’t seem to reflect that.
Browsing rentals on StreetEasy, prices seem to have fallen slightly from where they were three months ago – despite New York’s being the epicenter of a pandemic, and therefore:</description>
